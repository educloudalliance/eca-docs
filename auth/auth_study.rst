Education Authetication Attributes Study
========================================


To solve what attributes authentication customers need, a set of questions were sent to 14 potential stakeholders. 

Authentication is to identify users, and authentication data should contain only the info to identify person. For example license info is not included in authentication parameters, but with the unique id, license info could be asked from another service.

During the first round 6 of 14 answered, and on base of answers, the following attributes are chosen:

OID / unique identifier
  Unique identifies on national level. For example in Finland ‘Oppijanumero’. https://confluence.csc.fi/download/attachments/8127300/Oppijanumero+ja+OID.pdf

  All stakeholders who answered to questionnaire agreed to have this one. This was the most mandatory attribute.


Authorisation level
