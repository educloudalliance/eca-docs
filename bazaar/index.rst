The marketplace for content. The CMS publishes its material to the Bazaar and LMS requests access to the material from Bazaar.

Bazaar can also store and deliver materials on behalf of CMS.

Bazaar implements licensing and provisioning of material. User is never redirected to the CMS, if user has no access to the material.

Bazaar has two interfaces. The :doc:`CMS interface<interface_cms>` is used for adding material to the Bazaar and
viewing material through the Bazaar.
The :doc:`LMS interface<interface_lms>` is used for adding material to the LMS and viewing material from the LMS.
