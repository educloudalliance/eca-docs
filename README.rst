Contributions

If you have any questions you can raise issues in Github.
The name issue here is misleading a little bit. It is used to
mean pretty much anything. It is better to ask than not to.

If you want to contribute documentation you can submit pull requests.

The master branch in this repository is the latest and greatest
consensus. All changes to the master branch happen from pull requests.
All pull requests are approved by the ECA chief architect and the board.

Don't hesitate to open pull requests, or raise issues :)
