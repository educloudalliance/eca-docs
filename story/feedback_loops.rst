Feedback loops
**************

As a student I want to know how I am performing and what is my progress.

Goals are set and progress is made. It should be visible to the user.
It should be possible to see how my actions are changing the metrics.

As a user I should be able to set metrics and see the results in real time.

One way to implement this is to use gamification techniques.
