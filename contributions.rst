Contributions
*************

Everything happens in the open. No need to have strict rules
who can access what information.

If you want to contribute to ECA put your contributions in the
open and inform ECA about your contribution.

The specific process how this all happens is still a little bit open.

Documentation
=============

This repository is the place for communication about the
Educloud technical documentation.

If you have any questions you can raise issues in Github.
The name issue here is misleading a little bit. It is used to
mean pretty much anything. It is better to ask than not to.

If you want to contribute documentation you can submit pull requests.

The master branch in this repository is the latest and greatest
consensus. All changes to the master branch happen from pull requests.
All pull requests are approved by the ECA chief architect and the board.

Don't hesitate to open pull requests, or raise issues :)

Other contributions
===================

If you would like to contribute source code or functionality you need to

contribute.
