Contributions
*************

Everything happens in the open. No need to have strict rules
who can access what information.

If you want to contribute to ECA put your contributions in the
open and inform ECA about your contribution.

The specific process how this all happens is still a little bit open.
Easiest way to begin any contribution if you are not sure what to do
is to raise an issue in :term:`this repo`.

If you have any questions you can raise issues in Github.
The name issue here is misleading a little bit. It is used to
mean pretty much anything. It is better to ask than not to.

Documentation
=============

:term:`this repo` is the place for communication about the
Educloud technical documentation.

If you want to contribute documentation you should submit pull requests.

The master branch in this repository is the latest and greatest
consensus. All changes to the master branch happen from pull requests.
All pull requests are approved by the ECA chief architect.
If the change is fundamentally changing the documentation then
the chief architect raises the issue to the board. Board then decides
what should be done, based on the proposal from chief architect.

Don't hesitate to open pull requests, or raise issues :)

Source code or functionality
============================

If you would like to contribute source code or functionality you need to
sign Contributor License Agreement.

All source code and other material used in the reference implementation
must be licensed so that ECA, and all other parties, are free to use it
as basis for commercial production systems.

Please open an issue in this repository and tell what you would like to
contribute.
