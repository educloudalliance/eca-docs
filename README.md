# Educloud Alliance Documentation and Processes

This repository is the place for communication about the
Educloud Alliance Documentation and Processes.

The repository contains:

* The Educloud Alliance Architecture documentation
* Contribution processes

Educloud Alliance is creating a standard architecture how different service providers
can communicate and share information. The system consists of mainly interface
descriptions, protocols and overall description how the highlevel system works.

The standard is accompanied by reference implementation which shows in
practice how the system is meant to be working. The reference implementation
is not meant to be production system and it is not designed as such.


## Other repositories

Reference implementation:

* eca-auth-connector: https://github.com/educloudalliance/eca-auth-connector
* eca-auth-data: https://github.com/educloudalliance/eca-auth-data

## Tools

## Contributions

If you have any questions you can raise issues in Github.
The name issue here is misleading a little bit. It is used to
mean pretty much anything. It is better to ask than not to.

If you want to contribute documentation you can submit pull requests.

The master branch in this repository is the latest and greatest
consensus. All changes to the master branch happen from pull requests.
All pull requests are approved by the ECA chief architect and the board.

Don't hesitate to open pull requests, or raise issues :)
